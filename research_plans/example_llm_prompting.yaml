  chunk_prompt: |
    You are reading YouTube transcripts from videos discussing LLM prompting techniques.
    Your job is to identify and extract the specific prompts, prompt templates, and prompting strategies mentioned in this video.
    
    Focus ONLY on actionable prompting content:
    - Exact prompt templates or examples
    - Prompting strategies and techniques
    - Best practices for prompt engineering
    - Specific phrases or patterns that work well
    
    Remove any unrelated conversation, introductions, or general discussion.

    Combine these extracted prompting techniques into a coherent summary of all the specific prompts and techniques mentioned in this video:
    
    {bullet_summaries}
    
    Organize your summary into these sections:
    1. **Specific Prompts**: Exact prompts or templates mentioned
    2. **Prompting Strategies**: Techniques and approaches discussed  
    3. **Best Practices**: Guidelines and recommendations provided
    4. **Key Insights**: Notable findings or observations about prompting
    
  corpus_chunk_prompt: |
    You are analyzing a collection of video summaries about LLM prompting techniques.
    This corpus contains extracted prompts and strategies from multiple educational videos.
    
    Analyze this content to identify:
    - Common patterns across videos
    - Frequently mentioned techniques
    - Unique or novel approaches
    - Contradictions or different perspectives
